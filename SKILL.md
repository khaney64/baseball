## Notes

- Data is sourced from the MLB Stats API. See [copyright](http://gdx.mlb.com/components/copyright.txt).
- The MLB Stats API is free and open — no API key or authentication is required. Please don't abuse it. Excessive requests (rapid polling, bulk scraping, etc.) may result in your IP being blocked. When checking live games, poll no more than once every 15 seconds.
- The `live` and `score` commands accept either a numeric game PK or a team abbreviation. When using an abbreviation, the script looks up today's schedule to find the team's game. Use `--date MM/DD/YYYY` to look up a game on a different date.
- The `games` text output includes a Game ID column. Use this ID with `score` or `live` to drill into a specific game — especially useful for doubleheaders where team abbreviation alone is ambiguous.
